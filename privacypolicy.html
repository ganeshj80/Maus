        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 23 December 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>The Maus SPFx solutions (“the App”) runs entirely within Microsoft SharePoint. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles data when installed or used. This policy is designed to comply with the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> and other applicable data protection laws, including the European Union’s data privacy regulations.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The App <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data</strong> outside of your Microsoft 365 tenant. It only accesses SharePoint data that the current user is authorized to access, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SharePoint lists and libraries</li>
            <li>Site or page context information</li>
            <li>User profile information (if explicitly required by the App)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
        <p>All data accessed by the App is used solely to provide its intended functionality within SharePoint. The App does not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Log user activity</li>
            <li>Track users</li>
            <li>Use cookies or local storage for tracking</li>
            <li>Perform analytics outside Microsoft 365</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The App does <strong>not store any data externally</strong>. All data remains within your Microsoft 365 tenant and is subject to Microsoft’s security and compliance policies, including GDPR protections.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>The App does not share data with third parties or transmit data externally, except as explicitly documented in the App description. Any access to user data is governed by GDPR and local data protection laws.</p>

        <h2>6. User Rights under GDPR</h2>
        <p>If you are an EU user, you have the following rights under GDPR:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to access:</strong> You can request information about the personal data accessed by the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You may request correction of inaccurate personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to erasure:</strong> You may request deletion of personal data, subject to Microsoft 365 retention policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong> You may request limitation of data processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You may request your data in a portable format.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to object:</strong> You may object to processing where applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Requests can be made by contacting us via the details provided below.</p>

        <h2>7. Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App only requests the minimum SharePoint and Microsoft Graph permissions required to function. Permissions are clearly declared in the solution manifest and require tenant admin approval.</p>

        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>The App follows Microsoft SPFx development best practices and relies on SharePoint and Microsoft 365 security features to protect data, including GDPR-compliant data handling.</p>

        <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not designed for children under 13 and does not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in GDPR or other applicable data protection laws. Updates will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
